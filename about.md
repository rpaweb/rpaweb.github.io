<h2>Me.</h2>

<p align='justify'>My full name is Rafael PE√ëA-AZAR. Born in Colombia. Software engineer. RubyOnRails evangelizer. Systems Engineering professional from Unimagdalena (Colombia). I have a Master's degree in Web Engineering from Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (Espa√±a) where I obtained the highest qualification in my degree thesis (with a project focused on RubyOnRails developers). Also, certified in Software Quality Management. Passionate coder. Sometimes public speaker. Teacher/Mentor. Love all about Ruby (and Rails, and all infinite infinity gems ü§£). Crazy about Hotwire (Turbo, and Stimulus, and looking forward to Strada). I'm also enthusiast about Crystal and the Amber framework; and outside of the Ruby ecosystem I like Elixir and Phoenix very much, and obviously JavaScript (YES, I love WEB development). Married with Gina in 2017. I have 2 kids, Benjamin and Nicolas. I was an active TCG professional player in the past. Madness-level fan of Club Atl√©tico Boca Juniors since I can remember, being the only football/soccer team I support. Consider myself as a cats crazy person. I have a beautiful 11yo turkish-angora named Tom. Overall, a friendly guy and a family man.</p><br />
