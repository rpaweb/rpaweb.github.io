<h2>Me.</h2>

<p align='justify'>My name is RAFAEL PEÑA-AZAR. Born in Colombia. Software engineer. Well known as a RubyOnRails evangelizer. Systems Engineering professional from Unimagdalena (Colombia). I have a Master's degree in Web Engineering from Universidad Internacional de La Rioja (Spain) where I got the highest qualification in my degree thesis (with a project focused on RubyOnRails developers). Also, certified in Software Quality Management/Assurance (SQM/A) and Software Testing. Passionate coder. I love to speak in public (I'll update this later to share my talks here and the slides I used in them). Teacher/Mentor. Love all about Ruby (and Rails, and all the infinite infinity gems 🤣). Crazy about Hotwire (Turbo, Stimulus, Native). I'm also a Crystal enthusiast; and outside of the Ruby ecosystem I like Elixir and Phoenix a lot. Also time to time I work with Laravel, and make some deep work with C. Married since 2017 with the most beautiful girl. Father of the 3 smartest kids in existence: Benjamin, Nicolas and Tomas. I was also an active TCG professional player (and champion) in the past (don't know if I'll ever have the time to make a comeback 🤣). Madness-level fan of Club Atlético Boca Juniors since forever, being the only football/soccer team I really support. Overall, I'm a friendly guy and a family man.</p><br />
